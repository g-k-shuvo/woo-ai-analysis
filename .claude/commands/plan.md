# Plan Feature Implementation

Create a detailed implementation plan for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Rules
- DO NOT write any code yet. Only plan.
- Start by reading the relevant feature spec in `docs/features/` if one exists.
- If no feature spec exists, create one using the template at `docs/features/_template.md`.

## Steps

1. **Read Context**: Read the relevant `docs/ai/` files to understand current architecture
2. **Identify Scope**: List all files that will be created or modified
3. **Design Approach**: Describe the implementation step by step
4. **Data Model Impact**: Document any database changes needed
5. **API Changes**: Document any new or changed endpoints
6. **Test Plan**: Define unit, integration, and E2E tests needed
7. **Risk Assessment**: Identify edge cases, security concerns, performance risks
8. **Estimate Complexity**: Small (1-2 hours) / Medium (3-5 hours) / Large (6+ hours)
9. **Create/Update Feature Spec**: Write the plan into `docs/features/<slug>.md`

## Output
Create or update the feature spec at `docs/features/<slug>.md` with all findings.
Wait for my approval before implementing anything.
